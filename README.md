# Next Word Predictor
An interactive command line interface that uses the Hugging Face transformers library to predict the next word in a given text sequence.

The script uses Microsoft's Phi-1 model to generate text predictions, offering top-k predictions along with their probability scores. It also supports GPU acceleration with automatic fallback to CPU when needed.
